    <p class="indent">Liam Maxwell was born in Great Falls, Montana to a humble military family. When he was four years old, he moved to W&uuml;rzburg
      Germany, where much of his artistic interest and abilities began to surface. Influences of centuries old castles mixed
      with modern aesthetics sparked his artistic curiosity.

          Liam's first attempt at pottery created "Pottery Man".
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Liam created the "Pottery Man" while in Germany. Much of the influence of the piece came from visiting a Chirstmas
        Market at
        <a href="http://www.burg-ronneburg.de/">Ronneburg Castle</a> in Germany. The road leading up to the castle was lined with tents selling old-world armor and
        regalia.

      </figure>
      <p>Liam completed this project while living in Bellevue. He still had a facination with Germany having spent four years
        during the impressionable period of his life, which is why he chose the map of Europe. Additionally, he was rather
        infatuated with his older brother, who was creating a business idea with his friend.</p>

    <p>Liam created this piece in ceramic as an omage to his Dallas&rsquo; upstart business, Forever Love of Hip Hop (FLOHH).
      FLOHH was an upstart t-shirt business with ties to the hip hop movement.</p>

    <p>John Gill is a member of our family and quite the accomplished artist! John has work in major museums across the world,
      including the Louvre in Paris, Cairo, and Shanghai. While I knew of his work and familial ties, it wasn&rsquo;t until
      a family reunion in 2012 that we actually met in person. He gave Liam some pointers on how to get accepted into a good
      art school and said that a comprehensive portfolio of work would be better than a simple application.</p>

    <p>A fun comparison between Liam&rsquo;s first project and one of John&rsquo;s first projects he completed as a professional.
      John's pot has been handed down to our family and is a great conversation piece. While valuable to me, I hope that
      one day Liam's first pot will be as valuable as John&rsquo;s!</p>
