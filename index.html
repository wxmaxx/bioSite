    <p class="indent">Liam Maxwell was born in Great Falls, Montana to a humble military family. When he was four years old, he moved to W&uuml;rzburg Germany, where much of his artistic interest and abilities began to surface. Influences of centuries old castles mixed with modern aesthetics sparked his artistic curiosity.

      </figure>
      <p>Liam created the "Pottery Man" while in Germany. Much of the influence of the piece came from visiting a Christmas Market at <a href="http://www.burg-ronneburg.de/">Ronneburg Castle</a> in Germany. Tents selling old-world armor and regalia lined the road leading up to the castle.

      </figure>
      <p>Liam completed this project while living in Bellevue, Nebraska. He still had a fascination with Germany having spent four years during the impressionable period of his life, which is why he chose the map of Europe.  BUBBA FLOHH in the top left corner relates to a company that his older brother Dallas was putting together with one of his friends.  Liam&rsquo;s work tends to reflect his current interests.

    <p>Liam paid homage to his brother&rsquo;s upstart business by creating this piece in ceramic, Forever Love of Hip Hop (FLOHH).  Dallas and his friends got the idea to start FLOHH from watching the show Ridiculousness on Music Television.  In addition to this piece, Liam created some of the art used in the hats and t-shirts for the business.

    <p>John Gill is a member of our family and quite the accomplished artist! John has work in major museums across the world, including the Louvre in Paris, Cairo, and Shanghai.  While we knew of his work and familial ties, it wasn&rsquo;t until a family reunion in 2012 that we actually met in person. He gave Liam some pointers what he needed to be accepted into a good art school.  A comprehensive portfolio of work in addition to the application will give Liam the best chance for acceptance.

    <p>A fun comparison between Liam&rsquo;s first project and one of John&rsquo;s first projects he completed as a professional early on in his career.  John&rsquo;s pot has been handed down to our family and is a great conversation piece.  While valuable to the family, the hope is that one day Liam&rsquo;s first pot will be as valuable as John&rsquo;s!
