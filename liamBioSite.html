    <h1>Liam Maxwell's Bio</h1>
    <p class="indent">
      Liam Maxwell was born in Great Falls, Montana to a humble military family.  When he was four years old, he moved to W&uuml;rzburg Germany, where much of his artistic interest and abilities began to surface.  Influences of centuries old castles mixed with modern aesthetics sparked his artistic curiosity.
